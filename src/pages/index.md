  title: Jonas Williams
  description: >-
    Sierra Leonean born singer, songwriter and producer currently based in The
    Netherlands. He is a product of the generation that rendered havoc in that
    land. He chose his childhood dream of being a singer as a way to escape the
    chaos and instability. He founded the Earthian roots in the early nineties
    with friend from the ghetto. His inspirations are full of spirituality,
    reality and humanity. Peter Tosh is his mentor and idol. Due to the
    persistent warfare in Sierra Leone, he fled to Senegal where he had a brief
    spell in the Senegalese reggae scene. Destiny eventually took its toll and
    eventually went to France and finally settled in The Netherlands.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
